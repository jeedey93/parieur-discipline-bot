- Total Units Risked: 5.5u

**Other Recommended Plays**

> **BET OF THE DAY: Detroit Pistons -6.0 vs Cleveland Cavaliers @ 1.94**
> 
> The Pistons are playing at home with their primary rotation healthy and are capable of strong offensive outings, while the Cavaliers are known for their robust defensive scheme. This pick offers significant value as Detroit's strong home-court advantage and current offensive form are being underestimated by bookmakers, providing a solid edge despite some previous inconsistencies with similar spread plays; Bet of the Day selected based on strong historical performance in similar matchups from the previous day. 🔥 Confidence: High (1.5u) | Win Probability: 56%
> 
> Dallas Mavericks -4.5 vs Memphis Grizzlies @ 1.94
> 
> The Mavericks are playing at home with their core rotation healthy and are well-rested, facing a Memphis team that has recently struggled significantly. Dallas's consistent offensive output at home gives them a strong advantage, and the market hasn't fully adjusted to Memphis's recent poor form, creating a clear expected value here. 👍 Confidence: Medium (1u) | Win Probability: 55%
> 
> Boston Celtics -17.5 vs Brooklyn Nets @ 1.97
> 
> The dominant Celtics are at home with a full complement of players and no major fatigue concerns, facing a visiting Nets team that is a significantly weaker opponent. Boston's elite home performance and the substantial gap in team quality provide a strong mathematical edge against the large spread, with market valuation slightly underestimating their blowout potential. 👍 Confidence: Medium (1u) | Win Probability: 54%
> 
> Dallas Mavericks ML vs Memphis Grizzlies @ 1.54
> 
> The Mavericks are at home with a healthy core rotation and adequate rest, facing a Grizzlies team that has demonstrated recent struggles. This moneyline play presents a strong edge as Dallas's home-court dominance and superior current form are offering better value than implied by the odds. 👍 Confidence: Medium (1u) | Win Probability: 68%
> 
> Boston Celtics vs Brooklyn Nets Under 207.5 @ 1.95
> 
> Both teams have relatively healthy rosters without significant fatigue issues, with the Celtics' top-tier defense likely to limit scoring opportunities. The market total for this game appears slightly high given Boston's defensive prowess and the Nets' likely struggle to generate consistent offense, creating an attractive under opportunity. 👍 Confidence: Medium (1u) | Win Probability: 54%
