Other Recommended Plays

Winnipeg Jets @ San Jose Sharks Under 6.5 @ 1.90

Winnipeg boasts a formidable defensive structure and top-tier goaltending, while San Jose typically struggles to generate high-danger scoring chances.

Vegas Golden Knights ML vs Pittsburgh Penguins @ 1.67

The Golden Knights, with their deep roster and strong two-way play, face an inconsistent Penguins squad at home. Vegas's balanced attack and structured defense should exploit Pittsburgh's occasional defensive lapses. 👍 Confidence: Medium (1u) | Win Probability: 65%

Vegas Golden Knights @ Pittsburgh Penguins Under 6.5 @ 1.90

Vegas typically plays tight, defensively responsible games, often leaning on strong goaltending and a solid system.

Sacramento Kings +13.5 vs Los Angeles Lakers @ 1.95

Philadelphia 76ers +9.5 vs Boston Celtics @ 1.99

Both teams are well-rested and coming off good wins, but the 76ers receive a substantial +9.5 points against a strong Celtics team on the road.
