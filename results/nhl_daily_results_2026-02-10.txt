AI Analysis Summary:
As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I've thoroughly reviewed the provided lines. My focus remains on identifying legitimate +EV spots while strictly ignoring coin-flip matchups that offer no discernible edge.

Here are my top plays:

---

### **High Confidence Plays**

1.  **Edmonton Oilers (Away) @ 1.74 vs Anaheim Ducks**
    The Edmonton Oilers have been playing exceptional hockey, particularly offensively, while the Anaheim Ducks continue to struggle significantly. Given the stark difference in recent form and overall team quality, the Oilers' odds of 1.74 appear notably undervalued against a bottom-tier opponent.

### **Medium Confidence Plays**

1.  **Winnipeg Jets (Away) @ 1.70 vs Vancouver Canucks**
    The Winnipeg Jets boast elite goaltending and a strong defensive structure that travels well, making them a formidable road team. While Vancouver is a solid opponent, Winnipeg's consistent form suggests they are a valuable play at 1.70.
