ANALYSIS TASK:
1. Identify which plays appeared in both reports (consistency)
2. Identify which plays were added/removed between reports (line movement impact)
3. Identify confidence level changes for the same plays
4. Identify odds changes that affected recommendations
5. Provide a unified final recommendation list that:
   - Prioritizes plays that appeared in both reports (stronger conviction)
   - Includes only high/medium confidence plays
   - Maximum 5 total plays
   - Ranked by confidence %
   - Show the "Bet of the Day" first

Format the output similarly to your original report:

🏆 **BET OF THE DAY**
[Best play across both reports]

**Other Recommended Plays**
[Remaining plays]

Include a brief note about changes from morning to noon for each play (e.g., "Confidence increased due to line movement" or "New play added at noon based on updated odds")
