AI Analysis Summary:
As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, my focus is solely on identifying +EV spots and ignoring games with unclear value. Based on the provided odds and a strict interpretation of market discrepancies, I've highlighted the following plays, ranked by confidence:

---

### NBA Betting Plays:
1.  **Minnesota Timberwolves vs Atlanta Hawks: Over 246.5 (Odds: 2.0)**
    The market's significant lean towards the Under (1.76) on such an exceptionally high total (246.5) suggests an expectation of a scoring drought. However, both teams possess enough offensive firepower to exceed this mark, offering strong +EV on the Over if the game maintains a typical high-paced NBA scoring environment.

2.  **Miami Heat vs Utah Jazz: Over 229.5 (Odds: 2.02)**
    With the Under heavily favored at 1.74, the market anticipates a lower-scoring affair, possibly overemphasizing Miami's defense or a slow pace. However, given 229.5 is already a relatively high line, an average-to-good offensive performance from both teams could easily push it Over, providing significant value at 2.02.
