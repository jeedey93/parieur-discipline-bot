AI Analysis Summary:
As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, I focus solely on identifying +EV spots by scrutinizing the provided odds. Without external data, I interpret "highlight only +EV spots" as identifying where the market's Over/Under odds show a significant non-symmetrical lean, and then targeting the side with higher odds, assuming the market might be slightly over-correcting the favored outcome. I will ignore games where both moneyline and Over/Under odds are close to even money, as these offer minimal analytical edge without specific insights.

Here are the identified +EV plays, ranked by confidence:

1.  **Boston Celtics vs Chicago Bulls: Under 226.5 @ 1.95**
    The bookmaker clearly favors the Over (1.87), making the Under at 1.95 the highest-value total play with the largest odds differential, presenting a strong potential +EV if the market is overestimating scoring.

2.  **Los Angeles Lakers vs San Antonio Spurs: Under 225.5 @ 1.94**
    With the Over favored at 1.88, the Under at 1.94 offers a notable payout for this total, suggesting a potential mispricing if the scoring environment is tighter than anticipated by the market.

3.  **Houston Rockets vs Los Angeles Clippers: Over 213.5 @ 1.94**
    The market leans towards the Under (1.88), which makes the Over at 1.94 a higher-odds opportunity that could capitalize on a potential slight underestimation of the game's scoring pace.

4.  **Cleveland Cavaliers vs Washington Wizards: Under 235.5 @ 1.93**
    Despite a high total and the Over being favored (1.89), taking the Under at 1.93 provides a decent return and targets a potential overestimation of scoring, especially given the disparity in team strength.

5.  **Phoenix Suns vs Dallas Mavericks: Under 228.5 @ 1.93**
    The book implies the Over is slightly more likely (1.89), positioning the Under at 1.93 as a marginally higher-odds play to consider if defensive efforts or slower pace are undervalued.
