> The Heat are known for their strong coaching and consistent team-first approach, fielding a deep and resilient roster, while the Bucks' core may be aging or transitioning by 2026.

> **Atlanta Hawks -13.0 vs Washington Wizards @ 1.99**
> The Hawks are expected to be a competitive offensive team with strong playoff aspirations in 2026, facing a Wizards team that is likely still in a significant rebuilding phase with defensive liabilities.
