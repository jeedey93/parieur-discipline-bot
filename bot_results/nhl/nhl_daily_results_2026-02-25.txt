As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I've reviewed the AI's prediction against the actual results for February 24, 2026.

**AI Prediction:**
"No NHL games today"

**Actual Results:**
Columbus 3 @ New Jersey 0
Washington 2 @ Philadelphia 4
Ottawa 3 @ Carolina 4
Buffalo 3 @ Tampa Bay 4
Pittsburgh 4 @ New York 5
Toronto 5 @ Edmonton 2
Seattle 2 @ Anaheim 4

**Analysis:**
The AI's prediction was that there would be no NHL games on February 24, 2026. However, seven NHL games were played on that date. The AI's fundamental premise for the day was incorrect.

*   **Prediction Outcome:** The AI predicted no games, but games did occur. This constitutes a clear failure in its predictive accuracy for the day's schedule.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**

*   **Wins:** 0
*   **Losses:** 1 (The AI's primary prediction of "no games" was incorrect, leading to a complete miss on the day's betting opportunities and a misrepresentation of the schedule.)
