As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I've reviewed the AI's prediction against the actual results for February 24, 2026.

**AI Prediction:** "No NHL games today"

**Actual Results:**
*   Columbus 3 @ New Jersey 0
*   Washington 2 @ Philadelphia 4
*   Ottawa 3 @ Carolina 4
*   Buffalo 3 @ Tampa Bay 4
*   Pittsburgh 4 @ New York 5
*   Toronto 5 @ Edmonton 2
*   Seattle 2 @ Anaheim 4

**Analysis:**
The AI predicted there would be no NHL games today. However, seven games were played. This means the AI's prediction was incorrect.

**Summary:**
*   **Wins:** 0
*   **Losses:** 1 (The AI's prediction of "no games" was incorrect as multiple games were played.)
