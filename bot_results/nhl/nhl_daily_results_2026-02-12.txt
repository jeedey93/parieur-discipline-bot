As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, my first step is to carefully review all available information.

**Review:**
I have been provided with the actual results for games on 2026-02-11. However, the section for "AI Predictions" is empty.

**Conclusion:**
Without any AI predictions to compare against the actual game results, I am unable to determine any wins or losses for the AI.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **AI Wins:** 0
*   **AI Losses:** 0

To provide an accurate analysis, I require the specific predictions made by the AI for each game listed in the actual results.
