As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I must report that I am unable to fulfill your request.

The "AI Predictions" section is empty. Without the AI's predicted outcomes for each game (e.g., Moneyline, Puckline, Over/Under, specific team to win), it is impossible to compare them against the actual results and determine wins or losses.

Please provide the AI predictions so I can complete the analysis.
