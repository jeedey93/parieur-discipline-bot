As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I've reviewed the AI's prediction and the actual game results for 2026-02-19.

**AI Prediction:**
Date: 2026-02-19
Prediction: No NHL games today

**Actual Results:**
Columbus 3 @ New Jersey 0
Washington 2 @ Philadelphia 4
Ottawa 3 @ Carolina 4
Buffalo 3 @ Tampa Bay 4
Pittsburgh 4 @ New York 5
Toronto 5 @ Edmonton 2
Seattle 2 @ Anaheim 4

**Analysis:**
The AI predicted there would be "No NHL games today." However, the actual results clearly show that seven NHL games were played on this date.

Therefore, the AI's single prediction for the day regarding the schedule was incorrect.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **Wins:** 0
*   **Losses:** 1 (The AI's prediction of no games was a loss, as 7 games were played.)
