As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I have reviewed the AI's prediction against the actual game results for 2026-02-19.

**AI Prediction:** "No NHL games today"

**Actual Results:**
*   Columbus 3 @ New Jersey 0
*   Washington 2 @ Philadelphia 4
*   Ottawa 3 @ Carolina 4
*   Buffalo 3 @ Tampa Bay 4
*   Pittsburgh 4 @ New York 5
*   Toronto 5 @ Edmonton 2
*   Seattle 2 @ Anaheim 4

**Analysis:**
The AI's single prediction for the day was that there would be no NHL games. However, a full slate of 7 games was played. Therefore, the AI's prediction was incorrect.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **Total Wins:** 0
*   **Total Losses:** 1 (for the incorrect prediction that no games would be played)
