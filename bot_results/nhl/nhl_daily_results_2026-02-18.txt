As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I must adhere to strict protocols.

My analysis requires reviewing both the AI's predictions and the actual game results to determine wins and losses.

**Upon review, I note that the "AI Predictions" section for 2026-02-17 is empty.**

Without the AI's specific predictions (e.g., Moneyline, Puckline, Over/Under, or specific team picks), I am unable to determine wins or losses and, consequently, cannot provide a summary of the AI's performance.

Please provide the AI's predictions to allow for a proper analysis.
