As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I must adhere to strict protocols.

Upon review, I note that the "AI Predictions" section is empty. Without the AI's specific predictions for each game (e.g., which team was predicted to win, or specific score predictions), it is impossible to determine if the AI's bets were wins or losses against the actual results.

Therefore, I cannot provide a summary of wins and losses at this time. Please provide the AI's predictions for the games on 2026-02-21 to proceed with the analysis.
