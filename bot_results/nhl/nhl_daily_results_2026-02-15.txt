As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I must adhere to strict protocols.

Upon review, I note that the **AI Predictions are missing.**

Without the AI's specific predictions (e.g., predicted winners, score lines, or moneylines) for each game, I am unable to determine whether they were wins or losses against the actual results.

Therefore, I cannot provide a summary of wins and losses at this time. Please provide the AI's predictions to proceed with the analysis.
