As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I have reviewed the AI's predictions against the provided actual game results.

**Important Note on Data Consistency:**
It is crucial to highlight a significant discrepancy in the provided data. The "Actual Results" do not consistently align with the games for which the AI provided specific predictions and analysis. Out of the five explicit picks made by the AI, only one game could be directly matched and evaluated against the provided results. This limitation prevents a comprehensive review of all AI predictions.
