As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I have reviewed the AI predictions against the provided actual game results for February 25, 2026.

It is crucial to note a significant discrepancy: the "Actual Results" provided do not correspond to the specific matchups for which the AI made predictions, with only one exception. This makes a comprehensive evaluation of the AI's performance for this date largely impossible.

Here is the breakdown of each AI prediction:

    *   AI Predicted: Washington Capitals ML (Washington was the home team based on the odds and "vs" notation).

**Analyst's Note:**
A proper assessment of the AI's predictive capabilities requires accurate and corresponding game results for each recommended play. With only one prediction being evaluable, it is premature to draw conclusions about the AI's overall performance based on this limited data set. The provided actual results appear to be from a different set of games than the AI's predictions, preventing a fair and complete review.
