As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I've reviewed the AI's prediction and the actual game results for February 16, 2026.

**AI Prediction:**
The AI predicted: "No NHL games today"

**Actual Results:**
A full slate of 7 NHL games were played:
*   Columbus 3 @ New Jersey 0
*   Washington 2 @ Philadelphia 4
*   Ottawa 3 @ Carolina 4
*   Buffalo 3 @ Tampa Bay 4
*   Pittsburgh 4 @ New York 5
*   Toronto 5 @ Edmonton 2
*   Seattle 2 @ Anaheim 4

**Analysis:**
The AI's singular prediction for the day was that no games would occur. Given that seven games were actually played, this prediction was incorrect.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **Wins: 0**
*   **Losses: 1** (for the incorrect prediction that no games would be played)
