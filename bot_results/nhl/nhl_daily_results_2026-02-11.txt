As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I have reviewed the AI's prediction and the actual game results for February 10, 2026.

**AI Prediction:** "No NHL games today"

**Actual Results:** A full slate of NHL games were played.

**Analysis:**
The AI's single prediction for the day was that no games would occur. This prediction was fundamentally incorrect, as multiple games were played. Therefore, this prediction constitutes a loss.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **Wins:** 0
*   **Losses:** 1
