As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I've reviewed the AI's prediction against the actual game results for 2026-02-10.

**AI Prediction:**
"No NHL games today"

**Actual Results:**
Columbus 3 @ New Jersey 0
Washington 2 @ Philadelphia 4
Ottawa 3 @ Carolina 4
Buffalo 3 @ Tampa Bay 4
Pittsburgh 4 @ New York 5
Toronto 5 @ Edmonton 2
Seattle 2 @ Anaheim 4

The AI predicted that there would be no NHL games on February 10, 2026. However, seven NHL games were actually played on this date.

**Analysis:**
The AI's single prediction for the day, "No NHL games today," was definitively incorrect. This constitutes a loss for the AI's predictive model on this date.

**Summary:**
Total Wins: 0
Total Losses: 1
