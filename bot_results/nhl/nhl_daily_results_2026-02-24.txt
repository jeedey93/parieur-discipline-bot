As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I've reviewed the AI's prediction against the actual game results for February 23, 2026.

**AI Prediction:**
"No NHL games today"

**Actual Results:**
Several NHL games were played:
*   Columbus 3 @ New Jersey 0
*   Washington 2 @ Philadelphia 4
*   Ottawa 3 @ Carolina 4
*   Buffalo 3 @ Tampa Bay 4
*   Pittsburgh 4 @ New York 5
*   Toronto 5 @ Edmonton 2
*   Seattle 2 @ Anaheim 4

**Analysis:**
The AI's fundamental prediction that there would be no NHL games was incorrect, as seven games were played. This constitutes a complete failure to accurately assess the day's schedule.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **Wins:** 0
*   **Losses:** 1 (The prediction of "no games" was incorrect.)
