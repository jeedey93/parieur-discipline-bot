As a disciplined NHL betting analyst, I must first note a critical missing piece of information.

**Missing AI Predictions:**
The AI predictions for 2026-02-15 were not provided. Without these predictions, it is impossible to determine whether the AI had a win or a loss for any of the games based on the actual results.

To fulfill your request, I require the AI's specific predictions (e.g., moneyline, puckline, over/under, specific team win) for each game listed.

**Once the AI predictions are available, I will be able to perform the following analysis:**
1.  Compare each AI prediction against the actual game result.
2.  Determine if the prediction was a win or a loss according to standard betting outcomes.
3.  Compile a summary of the total wins and losses.
