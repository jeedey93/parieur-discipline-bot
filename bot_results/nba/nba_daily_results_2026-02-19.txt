As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, I have reviewed the AI's predictions and the (lack of) actual game results for 2026-02-18.

**AI Predictions:**
The AI explicitly stated: "No NBA games today or no odds available."

**Actual Results:**
No actual game results were provided for this date, which aligns with the AI's statement.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **Total Wins: 0**
*   **Total Losses: 0**

**Analyst's Note:**
The AI made no betting predictions for this date, as there were either no games scheduled or no available odds. Consequently, there are no outcomes (wins or losses) to record for this period. A disciplined approach requires evaluating only actual predictions against actual results.
