As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, my review of the AI predictions and actual results for February 17, 2026, yields the following:

**AI Predictions for 2026-02-17:**
*   "No NBA games today or no odds available"

**Actual Results for 2026-02-17:**
*   No specific game results were provided, which is consistent with the AI's assessment of no games or no available odds.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**

*   **Total Wins: 0**
*   **Total Losses: 0**

*Analysis:* The AI made no betting recommendations due to the stated absence of games or odds. Consequently, there were no wagers placed, and thus no wins or losses to record for this specific day. The AI's prediction regarding the lack of betting opportunities appears to have been accurate given the absence of actual game results to evaluate against.
