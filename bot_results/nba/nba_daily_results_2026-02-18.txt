As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, I have reviewed the AI predictions and the actual game results provided for February 17, 2026.

**AI Prediction Analysis:**
The AI prediction explicitly stated: "No NBA games today or no odds available."

**Actual Results Analysis:**
No specific game results were provided, which is consistent with the AI's prediction of no games or no available odds.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
Given that the AI's prediction was that no NBA games were played or no odds were available for betting, no wagers were placed on any specific game outcomes. Therefore, there are no wins or losses to report based on game results.

*   **Total Wins: 0**
*   **Total Losses: 0**

This outcome indicates a day of no betting activity, which is a key part of disciplined wagering when opportunities are not present.
