As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, I meticulously review all plays against their outcomes.

**Review of AI Betting Plays:**

The AI's betting plays were:
1.  **Minnesota Timberwolves vs Atlanta Hawks: Over 246.5**
2.  **Miami Heat vs Utah Jazz: Over 229.5**

**Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided "Actual Results," it is clear that the game outcomes for "Minnesota Timberwolves vs Atlanta Hawks" and "Miami Heat vs Utah Jazz" are *not* included. The results provided are for:
*   Indiana Pacers 137 @ New York Knicks 134
*   Los Angeles Clippers 95 @ Houston Rockets 102
*   Dallas Mavericks 111 @ Phoenix Suns 120
*   San Antonio Spurs 136 @ Los Angeles Lakers 108

Therefore, I am unable to determine the win/loss outcome for the specific bets made by the AI.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**

*   **Wins:** 0
*   **Losses:** 0
*   **Undetermined:** 2 (due to missing game results for the predicted matchups)
