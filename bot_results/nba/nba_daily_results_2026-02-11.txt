As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, I have reviewed the AI predictions and the actual game results.

The AI Analysis Summary explicitly states the following betting plays, ranked by confidence:

1.  **Minnesota Timberwolves vs Atlanta Hawks: Over 246.5**
2.  **Miami Heat vs Utah Jazz: Over 229.5**

However, the "Actual Results" provided are for different games:

*   Indiana Pacers 137 @ New York Knicks 134
*   Los Angeles Clippers 95 @ Houston Rockets 102
*   Dallas Mavericks 111 @ Phoenix Suns 120
*   San Antonio Spurs 136 @ Los Angeles Lakers 108

Since the actual results provided do not correspond to the AI's explicit betting plays (Minnesota vs Atlanta, and Miami vs Utah), it is not possible to determine a win or loss for the AI's stated predictions based on the information given.

Therefore, I cannot provide a summary of wins and losses for the AI's specific plays. To evaluate the AI's performance, the actual results for the Minnesota Timberwolves vs Atlanta Hawks game and the Miami Heat vs Utah Jazz game would be required.
