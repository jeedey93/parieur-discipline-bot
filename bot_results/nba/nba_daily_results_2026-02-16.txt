As a disciplined NBA betting analyst, I have reviewed the AI predictions and the actual game information for 2026-02-15.

**AI Predictions for 2026-02-15:**
*   "No NBA games today or no odds available"

**Actual Results:**
*   (Implied: No games played or no odds available, aligning with the AI's statement.)

**Analysis:**
The AI's prediction was that no NBA games were scheduled or had available odds for betting on this date. As such, no specific wagers or outcomes were predicted for individual games. Therefore, no wins or losses can be attributed to specific game predictions.

**Summary of Wins and Losses:**
*   **Total Wins:** 0
*   **Total Losses:** 0

The AI's assessment meant there was no betting action for today, resulting in neither a win nor a loss on specific game outcomes.
