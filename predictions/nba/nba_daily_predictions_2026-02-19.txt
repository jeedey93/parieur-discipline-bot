AI Analysis Summary:
Here are today's mispriced probabilities:

**High Confidence**
San Antonio Spurs -7.5 vs Phoenix Suns @ 1.91 Units: 1.5u
The Phoenix Suns are severely impacted by the absence of their key offensive stars, while the young San Antonio Spurs will be playing at home with Victor Wembanyama leading the charge. The Spurs' home advantage and the Suns' significant injury woes, with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal all likely out, create a substantial mismatch for San Antonio to cover a modest spread.

Houston Rockets -4.5 vs Charlotte Hornets @ 1.99 Units: 1.5u
The Charlotte Hornets are heavily depleted by injuries to core starters like LaMelo Ball and Mark Williams, facing a disciplined Houston Rockets team known for its strong defense. Houston's defensive prowess and the Hornets' struggles to generate consistent offense without key playmakers give the Rockets a clear path to win by a comfortable margin.

Boston Celtics -5.5 vs Golden State Warriors @ 1.94 Units: 1.5u
The Boston Celtics are an elite, well-rounded team playing at home, while the Golden State Warriors often struggle with consistency and defense on the road against top opponents. Boston's dominant home court advantage and superior two-way play make them well-equipped to overcome the Warriors by more than five points.

Chicago Bulls +5.5 vs Toronto Raptors @ 1.94 Units: 1.5u
The Toronto Raptors are significantly shorthanded with key players like Scottie Barnes and Jakob Poeltl sidelined, presenting a talent advantage for the Chicago Bulls. Despite their own inconsistencies, the Bulls should be able to keep this game close or even win outright against a severely depleted Raptors roster.

**Medium Confidence**
Indiana Pacers -3.5 vs Washington Wizards @ 2.0 Units: 1u
The high-octane Indiana Pacers offense faces a defensively challenged Washington Wizards team, both playing on a standard schedule. The Pacers' superior offensive firepower and the Wizards' persistent defensive struggles provide a strong basis for Indiana to win by at least four points.

Atlanta Hawks ML vs Philadelphia 76ers @ 2.0 Units: 1u
The Philadelphia 76ers are likely without star center Joel Embiid, which severely impacts their offensive and defensive capabilities, while the Atlanta Hawks arrive with their primary scorers ready. Atlanta's dynamic offense, led by Trae Young, should capitalize on Philadelphia's depleted lineup and lack of rim protection to secure a road victory.

Denver Nuggets -4.5 vs Los Angeles Clippers @ 2.01 Units: 1u
The reigning champion Denver Nuggets, featuring Nikola Jokic, consistently perform at an elite level, facing a strong Los Angeles Clippers team that can sometimes lack consistent focus. Denver's disciplined execution and overall team cohesion give them a solid edge to defeat the Clippers on the road by more than four points.

Detroit Pistons +4.5 vs New York Knicks @ 1.88 Units: 1u
The New York Knicks are without Julius Randle, and potentially OG Anunoby, which significantly hampers their two-way effectiveness against an improving Detroit Pistons squad. The Pistons' recent competitive play combined with the Knicks' substantial injury absences suggests Detroit can keep the game within a narrow margin.

Under 224.5 vs Sacramento Kings @ 1.95 Units: 1u
The Orlando Magic possess an elite defense and control tempo effectively, contrasting with the high-paced Sacramento Kings, setting up a clash of styles. Orlando's defensive strength and ability to slow down opponents will likely limit Sacramento's scoring opportunities, pushing the game total below 224.5 points.

**Lean**
Brooklyn Nets +16.0 vs Cleveland Cavaliers @ 1.93 Units: 0.5u
The Cleveland Cavaliers are a dominant defensive team currently in strong form, but facing a Brooklyn Nets team that, while inconsistent, has shown flashes of offensive capability. While the Cavaliers are favorites, covering such a large spread is a significant challenge against an an NBA team, and the Nets may be able to secure enough late-game scoring to stay within the number.

---
Bet of the Day: San Antonio Spurs -7.5 vs Phoenix Suns @ 1.91
The young San Antonio Spurs have shown flashes of brilliance, especially with Victor Wembanyama's growing impact, and are playing with increasing confidence at home. This game presents an extreme mismatch as the Phoenix Suns are expected to be without their entire star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal, leaving them severely depleted. The absence of these three perennial All-Stars turns the Suns into a skeleton crew, making them highly vulnerable to even a developing team like the Spurs, who will look to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity at home and secure a decisive victory.
