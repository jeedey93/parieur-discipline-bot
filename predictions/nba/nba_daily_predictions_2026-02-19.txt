The San Antonio Spurs, spearheaded by a dominant Victor Wembanyama, are a rapidly ascending team, while the Phoenix Suns are without Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, leaving Devin Booker with less support.

Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u

Denver Nuggets ML vs Los Angeles Clippers @ 1.52
The Denver Nuggets, featuring the MVP-caliber Nikola Jokic along with Jamal Murray, maintain their status as a championship-level team. They are facing a Los Angeles Clippers squad that, while competitive, may lack the consistent firepower to challenge the Nuggets' cohesive unit.
