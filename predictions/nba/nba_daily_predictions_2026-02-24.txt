Minnesota Timberwolves -6.5 vs Portland Trail Blazers @ 1.91

This matchup heavily favors Minnesota, whose collective strength and discipline should comfortably cover the spread against a less experienced Portland squad.

Cleveland Cavaliers -4.0 vs New York Knicks @ 1.99

Miami Heat -6.5 vs Milwaukee Bucks @ 1.95
The Heat are known for their strong coaching and consistent team-first approach, fielding a deep and resilient roster, while the Bucks' core may be aging or transitioning by 2026.
