BET OF THE DAY:
Los Angeles Clippers -9.0 vs New Orleans Pelicans @ 1.94

Denver Nuggets -3.0 vs Minnesota Timberwolves @ 1.96

Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 57%

Milwaukee Bucks -3.5 vs Chicago Bulls @ 1.96
The Bucks are well-rested after two days off, facing a Bulls team that is also rested but historically struggles in this type of matchup. Despite a recent loss, the underlying metrics suggest the Bucks are undervalued at this spread, presenting a favorable expected value.

San Antonio Spurs ML vs New York Knicks @ 1.88
The Spurs are showing strong recent form with consecutive wins and a good rest advantage over the Knicks, who are coming off a loss. This pick holds value as the market slightly underprices the Spurs' current momentum and ability to secure an outright victory at home.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 58%

Atlanta Hawks -6.0 vs Portland Trail Blazers @ 1.95
The Hawks are a strong home team and enter this game well-rested, facing a Trail Blazers squad that typically struggles on the road.
