**Historical Self-Evaluation Summary:**
The model has exhibited inconsistent performance on spread bets, notably a 2-8 record over the last 10 spread plays across February 25th and 27th, indicating a systematic issue with general spread predictions. Conversely, the model maintains a perfect 2-0 record on Moneyline selections and demonstrated strong success with large favorite spreads on February 26th. Based on this, caution is exercised with most spread plays, focusing on Moneyline, Totals, or high-confidence large spreads where historical performance shows positive patterns.

BET OF THE DAY:
Toronto Raptors -13.5 vs Washington Wizards @ 1.94
The Toronto Raptors, well-rested after two days off, face a likely struggling Washington Wizards team, which appears to be in a tanking phase. This large spread offers significant value, as the model's historical performance indicates strong accuracy in identifying and covering large favorite spreads against weaker opposition.

**Other Recommended Plays**

Utah Jazz vs New Orleans Pelicans Over 246.5 @ 1.94
Both the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans come into this game well-rested, suggesting both offenses should be fresh and capable of running at a high pace. The elevated total presents an edge as both teams possess offensive firepower, likely leading to a high-scoring affair that exceeds bookmakers' expectations.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 54%

Los Angeles Lakers ML vs Golden State Warriors @ 1.62
The Los Angeles Lakers, playing at home with ample rest, are poised to leverage their strong current form against the Golden State Warriors, who are also rested but enter a tough road environment. This Moneyline pick presents a solid edge, as the market's implied probability undervalues the Lakers' outright win potential in this rivalry matchup.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 64%

Houston Rockets ML vs Miami Heat @ 1.72
The Houston Rockets enter this game on a back-to-back, yet recent performance against similar competition suggests they carry strong momentum into this matchup against the Miami Heat, who had a day of rest. Despite the fatigue factor, the perceived value in the Moneyline indicates the market is underestimating Houston's ability to secure a home victory.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 60%
