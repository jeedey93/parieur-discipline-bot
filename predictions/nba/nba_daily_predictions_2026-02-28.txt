**Other Recommended Plays**

Houston Rockets ML vs Miami Heat @ 1.75
The Houston Rockets, coming off a victory on a back-to-back, have the home-court advantage against a Miami Heat team also playing on zero days rest after a loss. Houston's recent form and home-court energy give them a notable edge against a potentially fatigued Miami squad.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 60%

Los Angeles Lakers ML vs Golden State Warriors @ 1.63
The Los Angeles Lakers enter this contest well-rested at home, facing a Golden State Warriors team on the second leg of a back-to-back after a high-scoring game. This rest advantage, coupled with the Lakers' talent, creates a significant probabilistic edge that the market has not fully priced in.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 64%

New Orleans Pelicans -6.0 vs Utah Jazz @ 1.91
With both teams well-rested, the New Orleans Pelicans possess a superior overall roster and are expected to assert their dominance against the Utah Jazz. The Pelicans' offensive firepower and defensive capabilities should allow them to cover this moderate spread against a less consistent Jazz team.
