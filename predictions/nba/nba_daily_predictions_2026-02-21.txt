Current Roster Data Verified.

**Miami Heat -9.5 vs Memphis Grizzlies @ 1.91**
The Heat boast a fully healthy and cohesive roster, enjoying ample rest at home, while the Grizzlies are severely hampered by multiple key injuries to their core rotation and face the fatigue of a back-to-back road game. This extreme injury mismatch, combined with Miami's elite defense and consistent offensive flow, creates significant value against a struggling Memphis squad, reflecting a clear mispricing by bookmakers on this spread.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u

**Detroit Pistons -10.5 vs Chicago Bulls @ 1.91**
The Pistons enter this matchup fully healthy and in excellent form, ready to exploit a struggling Bulls team dealing with minor depth injuries and playing on a demanding back-to-back schedule. Detroit's potent offense and solid defense are well-positioned to dominate a fatigued Chicago squad that has shown significant defensive lapses, offering a strong statistical edge over the implied probability.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u

**New York Knicks -3.5 vs Houston Rockets @ 1.95**
The Knicks bring their elite defensive intensity and improved offensive consistency to their home court, fully healthy and well-rested, against a Rockets team that is inconsistent on the road and has a key role player listed as doubtful. New York's ability to control the pace and lock down opponents provides a clear matchup advantage, suggesting a higher win probability than the market implies for covering this spread.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u

**San Antonio Spurs -18.0 vs Sacramento Kings @ 1.91**
The Spurs are at full strength, well-rested, and playing at home, while the Kings are decimated by multiple core starter injuries and are on a taxing back-to-back road trip. This monumental disparity in team health, rest, and current form creates a significant advantage for San Antonio to comfortably cover this large spread against a heavily compromised Sacramento roster.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u

**Philadelphia 76ers -3.5 vs New Orleans Pelicans @ 1.94**
The 76ers feature a strong, healthy core and are well-rested, bringing a high-powered offense and dominant defense to face the Pelicans, who are dealing with a minor rotation injury and have shown recent inconsistency. Philadelphia's superior talent and cohesive play, particularly against an opponent prone to defensive struggles, provide a solid edge for covering the spread as road favorites.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u

**Phoenix Suns ML vs Orlando Magic @ 1.83**
