### BET OF THE DAY
Denver Nuggets +8.0 vs Oklahoma City Thunder @ 1.99
The Nuggets, despite recent mixed results, possess a championship core and rarely falter significantly, while the young Thunder are strong at home but face a motivated veteran opponent. This spread provides value as bookmakers may be overvaluing the Thunder's home dominance against a proven, resilient Nuggets squad, especially after the AI's recent caution regarding Nuggets' spreads.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 55%

### Other Recommended Plays
Milwaukee Bucks +8.5 vs New York Knicks @ 1.99
The Milwaukee Bucks, playing at home, generally exhibit strong resilience, while the New York Knicks have shown some vulnerability against the spread in recent outings. This play capitalizes on the Bucks' ability to keep games close at home, and confidence is adjusted upwards due to the Knicks' recent two spread losses in similar situations.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 54%

Cleveland Cavaliers +6.5 vs Detroit Pistons @ 1.95
The Cleveland Cavaliers are a strong, well-rounded team, and should be looking for a bounce-back performance against a rebuilding Pistons squad that recently lost a spread bet. Bookmakers are offering a favorable line for the Cavaliers to either win outright or keep the game within a comfortable margin against a team that is often inconsistent.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 55%
