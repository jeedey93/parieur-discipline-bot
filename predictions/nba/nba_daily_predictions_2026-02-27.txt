Dallas Mavericks -4.5 vs Memphis Grizzlies @ 1.94
The Mavericks are playing at home with their core rotation healthy and are well-rested, facing a Memphis team that has recently struggled significantly.

Boston Celtics -17.5 vs Brooklyn Nets @ 1.97
The dominant Celtics are at home with a full complement of players and no major fatigue concerns, facing a visiting Nets team that is a significantly weaker opponent.

Boston Celtics vs Brooklyn Nets Under 207.5 @ 1.95
