BET OF THE DAY:
Winnipeg Jets ML vs Anaheim Ducks @ 1.78
The Jets bring elite goaltending and a stifling defensive structure to face an Anaheim team still finding consistency, especially in their own end. Winnipeg's superior underlying metrics and form provide a strong statistical advantage, making the market price an undervalued opportunity despite Anaheim's home ice.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 68%

**Other Recommended Plays**
Florida Panthers ML vs Buffalo Sabres @ 1.87
The Panthers, playing at home, boast a strong defensive identity and consistent offensive depth against a talented but often inconsistent Sabres squad. Florida's strong home record and superior goal prevention metrics create a significant edge over Buffalo's sometimes high-event, porous defense.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 62%

Vegas Golden Knights ML vs Washington Capitals @ 1.98
Vegas, a deep and analytically strong team, faces an aging Capitals roster that often relies on veteran play rather than dominant underlying metrics. The Golden Knights' better possession and high-danger chance generation suggest they are slightly undervalued in this road matchup.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 56%
