AI Analysis Summary:
As a disciplined NHL analyst, I've filtered out games lacking clear value and focused solely on what I perceive as +EV opportunities based on the provided odds and my analytical framework. Coin-flip games with tight odds offer minimal edge and are ignored.

Here are the highlighted plays, ranked by confidence:

---

### **1. Toronto Maple Leafs @ Edmonton Oilers**
*   **Play:** Toronto Maple Leafs to Win @ 2.00
*   **Confidence:** High
*   **Rationale:** The Maple Leafs' potent offense matches up well against the Oilers, and their recent form suggests they can capitalize on defensive lapses. The odds provide solid value for a road win.

### **2. Carolina Hurricanes vs Ottawa Senators**
*   **Play:** Carolina Hurricanes to Win @ 1.70
*   **Confidence:** Medium-High
*   **Rationale:** Carolina's home-ice advantage and depth give them the edge over Ottawa. The Hurricanes' consistent play at home makes them a strong favorite.

### **3. Anaheim Ducks vs Seattle Kraken**
*   **Play:** Anaheim Ducks to Win @ 2.05
*   **Confidence:** Medium
*   **Rationale:** Anaheim's recent improvements and home performance make them a live underdog against the Kraken. The odds offer value for a team trending upward.
