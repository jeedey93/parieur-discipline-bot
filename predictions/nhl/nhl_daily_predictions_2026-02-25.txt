**RECOMMENDED PLAYS**

Edmonton Oilers ML vs Anaheim Ducks @ 1.87
The Oilers, despite playing on the road, possess superior offensive talent and should control the pace against the Ducks' rebuilding squad. Anaheim's defensive inconsistencies and goaltending challenges are expected to be exploited by Edmonton's potent attack.
This pricing suggests a closer game than our projections indicate, offering a clear edge on a stronger Oilers team to secure a regulation win.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Confidence : 4.52%

Dallas Stars ML vs Seattle Kraken @ 1.6
The Dallas Stars boast a formidable defensive structure and reliable goaltending, giving them a significant edge at home against a Seattle team that can struggle with consistent offensive output. The Stars excel at limiting dangerous chances and converting on their own opportunities.
The market undervalues Dallas's home advantage and defensive shutdown capabilities against a less potent offensive opponent.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Confidence : 4.5%

New Jersey Devils ML vs Buffalo Sabres @ 1.92
The Devils, known for their high-tempo offense and home-ice advantage, match up well against a Sabres team that, while talented, often lacks defensive consistency and elite goaltending. New Jersey's speed and offensive pressure should create numerous scoring opportunities.
This play offers value as the market is pricing a near coin-flip, but our analysis points to a stronger Devils performance at home.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Confidence : 3.92%

Washington Capitals ML vs Philadelphia Flyers @ 1.66
The Capitals typically exhibit strong defensive play and solid goaltending at home, facing a Flyers team that, while gritty, might struggle to break through Washington's structured defense. Washington's veteran presence and opportunistic offense give them an edge in this divisional clash.
The odds provide a slight value on the Capitals, who are historically reliable home favorites against mid-tier opposition.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Confidence : 3.76%
