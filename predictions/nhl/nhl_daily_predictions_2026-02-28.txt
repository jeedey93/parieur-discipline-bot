Chicago Blackhawks @ Colorado Avalanche Over 6.5 @ 1.85
This matchup features Colorado's high-octane offense against a Blackhawks team prone to defensive lapses, setting the stage for a high-scoring affair. Both teams have shown tendencies towards high-event games, and the Avalanche's offensive firepower should exploit Chicago's weaknesses.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 60%

Tampa Bay Lightning vs Buffalo Sabres Under 6.5 @ 1.95
The Lightning's strong goaltending and defensive capability, coupled with the Sabres' inconsistent offense, suggests a lower-scoring game than implied by the total. Tampa Bay tends to play tight games at home, and their ability to shut down opponents provides value on the under.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 56%

Los Angeles Kings vs Calgary Flames Under 5.5 @ 1.90
Both the Kings and Flames are defensively structured teams with strong goaltending, indicating a grind-it-out, low-scoring contest. This matchup aligns with the Kings' recent trend of playing tight games at home, where their defense and elite netminder excel.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 57%
