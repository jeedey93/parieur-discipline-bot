**Other Recommended Plays**

St. Louis Blues ML vs New Jersey Devils @ 1.93
St. Louis benefits from ample rest at home, facing a New Jersey Devils squad playing on a back-to-back, which should heavily impact their defensive and goaltending performance. The Blues are well-positioned to capitalize on the Devils' fatigue and potential deployment of a backup goalie.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 59%

Los Angeles Kings vs Calgary Flames Under 5.5 @ 1.91
This matchup features two teams known for structured defensive play and strong goaltending, with both having had sufficient rest. The Kings consistently drive low-scoring games at home, and the Flames are capable of matching that defensive intensity, making the Under a compelling play.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 57.5%

Tampa Bay Lightning vs Buffalo Sabres Over 6.5 @ 1.91
Both the Lightning and Sabres are on a back-to-back, suggesting potential defensive breakdowns and tired goaltending, which typically leads to higher-scoring affairs. Tampa Bay's potent offense combined with Buffalo's ability to score against fatigued defenses provides a clear path to the Over.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 57.5%

Vancouver Canucks vs Seattle Kraken Under 6.0 @ 1.91
The Kraken play a tight, defensive style, especially at home, and the Canucks also possess strong goaltending and a capable defensive system. With both teams well-rested, this Pacific Division rivalry is expected to be a low-event, grind-it-out game, offering value on the Under.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 57.5%
