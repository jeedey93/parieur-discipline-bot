BET OF THE DAY:
Winnipeg Jets ML vs San Jose Sharks @ 1.85
The Jets, well-rested, face a San Jose team on a back-to-back after being shut out yesterday, creating a significant mismatch in energy and talent. Winnipeg's superior defensive structure and motivation for a bounce-back win provide a strong market edge over the fatigued Sharks.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 64%

**Other Recommended Plays**
Calgary Flames vs Anaheim Ducks Under 6.5 @ 1.90
Calgary is on a back-to-back after a 2-0 shutout win, indicating a likely focus on tight defensive play while fatigued. Anaheim's offense is inconsistent, and the Flames' recent performance suggests a lower-scoring affair where bookmakers might be overcompensating for the Ducks' previous high-scoring game.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 61%

Vegas Golden Knights ML vs Pittsburgh Penguins @ 1.69
Vegas comes in with a day's rest and strong recent form, while Pittsburgh recently suffered a significant home loss, suggesting underlying issues that Vegas can exploit. The Golden Knights' consistent play and solid goaltending offer a clear advantage against an inconsistent Penguins squad.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 66%

Chicago Blackhawks @ Utah Mammoth Over 6.0 @ 1.90
Chicago's notoriously weak defense and Utah's potent offense, coupled with both teams having adequate rest, set the stage for an elevated goal count. The Blackhawks' inability to suppress high-danger chances consistently makes the Over a strong play, as Utah will capitalize frequently.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 59%
