BET OF THE DAY:
Winnipeg Jets ML vs San Jose Sharks @ 1.85
The Winnipeg Jets, a strong defensive team with elite goaltending, face the struggling San Jose Sharks who often concede high-danger chances. Winnipeg is well-rested after two days off, contrasting with San Jose's generally weaker lineup. The market is underpricing Winnipeg's superior underlying metrics and form against a significantly weaker opponent, creating a valuable edge in this matchup.

Vegas Golden Knights ML vs Pittsburgh Penguins @ 1.67
The Vegas Golden Knights possess a deep roster and strong offensive capabilities, and are well-rested coming into this road matchup against an inconsistent Pittsburgh Penguins team. Vegas's advanced metrics typically favor them against teams like Pittsburgh, who can be prone to defensive lapses. Despite a recent loss, Vegas offers a solid edge at 1.67 odds, as their true win probability is higher than the implied probability from bookmakers, identifying a mispriced opportunity.
