Current Roster Data Verified.

BET OF THE DAY:
Florida Panthers vs New York Islanders Under 6.0 @ 1.90
The Panthers are significantly hampered by injuries to core skaters Aleksander Barkov and Seth Jones, severely impacting their offensive and defensive capabilities against a tight-checking Islanders team. With the Islanders' elite goalie Sorokin expected to start due to Semyon Varlamov's injury, and key offensive players out for Florida, scoring is expected to be suppressed, offering strong value on the Under.
Confidence Level: High Units: 1.5u | Win Probability: 62%

**Other Recommended Plays**
Winnipeg Jets vs San Jose Sharks Under 6.0 @ 1.90
Winnipeg, featuring elite goaltending and strong defensive metrics, faces a struggling San Jose offense that consistently finds it difficult to generate high-danger chances. This matchup favors a low-scoring affair as the Jets look to stifle the Sharks' limited attack.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 58%

St Louis Blues vs Minnesota Wild Under 6.0 @ 1.90
The Blues are missing core offensive talent Robert Thomas, which severely impacts their scoring potential against a defensively responsible Wild team that generally excels at home. With both teams likely to play a structured game and key offensive pieces absent, the Under presents a favorable betting opportunity.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 57%

Calgary Flames vs Anaheim Ducks Under 6.5 @ 1.90
Both the Flames and Ducks are significantly depleted by injuries to key offensive players like Jonathan Huberdeau for Calgary and Troy Terry, Mikael Granlund, and Ryan Strome for Anaheim, while Calgary is also on a back-to-back. Despite Anaheim's recent high-scoring games, the sheer volume of injured offensive talent and fatigue points to a lower-scoring contest, creating value on the Under.
Confidence Level: Medium Units: 1u | Win Probability: 57%
