BET OF THE DAY:
Vegas Golden Knights ML vs Pittsburgh Penguins @ 1.68
The Vegas Golden Knights, coming off two days of rest, face a Pittsburgh Penguins team also well-rested after their last game. Vegas typically demonstrates stronger underlying metrics and road performance against inconsistent opponents.
Their strong offensive system and solid defensive structure, combined with market odds that undervalue their true win probability by 4.5%, presents a clear edge for this moneyline play.
