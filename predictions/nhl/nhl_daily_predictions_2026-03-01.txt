AI Analysis Summary:
BET OF THE DAY
Calgary Flames vs Anaheim Ducks Under 6.5 @ 1.90
Calgary, playing on a back-to-back, and Anaheim both face significant offensive challenges due to key injuries, with Jonathan Huberdeau out for the Flames and Mikael Granlund, Troy Terry, and Ryan Strome sidelined for the Ducks. This confluence of factors, including player fatigue and substantial offensive absences, strongly suggests a lower-scoring game than the market anticipates.

**Other Recommended Plays**
Florida Panthers vs New York Islanders Under 6.0 @ 1.90
The Panthers are missing key offensive weapons including Aleksander Barkov and Tomas Nosek, while the Islanders are without Kyle Palmieri, severely impacting both teams' scoring potential. Despite Islanders starting goalie Semyon Varlamov being out, the significant injuries to core offensive skaters on both sides create a favorable environment for an Under play, indicating the market has mispriced the total.
