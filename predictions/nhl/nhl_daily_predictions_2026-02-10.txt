AI Analysis Summary:
Here are the top +EV NHL betting spots from the provided slate, ranked by confidence:

---

1.  **Edmonton Oilers @ Anaheim Ducks**
    *   **Play:** Edmonton Oilers (Away) @ 1.74
    *   **Confidence:** High
    *   **Explanation:** The Oilers are one of the league's hottest teams, playing against a struggling Ducks squad that consistently underperforms. Edmonton's true probability of winning is significantly higher than the implied 57.47% from these odds.

2.  **Winnipeg Jets @ Vancouver Canucks**
    *   **Play:** Winnipeg Jets (Home) @ 2.15
    *   **Confidence:** Medium-High
    *   **Explanation:** Winnipeg is an elite defensive team and formidable at home, making them a live underdog against a strong Canucks team. The 2.15 odds undervalue the Jets' quality and home-ice advantage in this matchup.

3.  **Toronto Maple Leafs @ Tampa Bay Lightning**
    *   **Play:** Toronto Maple Leafs (Away) @ 2.6
    *   **Confidence:** Medium
    *   **Explanation:** While Tampa Bay is tough at home, the Maple Leafs possess enough offensive firepower to win any game. Odds of 2.6 (implying a 38.46% win probability) present value for a team with Toronto's high-end talent.

---
**Games to Ignore (Coin-Flips / No Clear Edge):**

*   **Buffalo Sabres @ New Jersey Devils:** Too tight a line, both teams are competitive, making it a near coin-flip.
*   **Vegas Golden Knights @ Los Angeles Kings:** A divisional rivalry with very close odds, indicating high uncertainty and no clear value.
*   **Philadelphia Flyers @ Washington Capitals:** While Capitals are favored, the odds accurately reflect the general expectation without offering significant value on either side.
*   **Seattle Kraken @ Dallas Stars:** Dallas is a strong favorite, and Seattle's struggles make these odds appear fair without a clear +EV opportunity.
