AI Analysis Summary:
As a disciplined NHL analyst, I've filtered out games lacking clear value and focused solely on what I perceive as +EV opportunities based on the provided odds and my analytical framework. Coin-flip games with tight odds offer minimal edge and are ignored.

Here are the highlighted plays, ranked by confidence:

---

### **1. Winnipeg Jets @ Vancouver Canucks**
*   **Play:** Vancouver Canucks to Win @ 2.15
*   **Confidence:** High
*   **Rationale:** The Canucks, playing at home, offer excellent value as slight underdogs against a strong Jets team. Their offensive firepower and home-ice advantage suggest their true win probability is undervalued by these odds.

### **2. Philadelphia Flyers @ Washington Capitals**
*   **Play:** Philadelphia Flyers to Win @ 2.6
*   **Confidence:** Medium-High
*   **Rationale:** The Flyers have shown resilience and strong goaltending this season, making them a live underdog in divisional matchups. The Capitals, despite being favored, are likely slightly overvalued against a gritty Flyers team that can steal wins.

### **3. Toronto Maple Leafs @ Tampa Bay Lightning**
*   **Play:** Toronto Maple Leafs to Win @ 2.6
*   **Confidence:** Medium
*   **Rationale:** While Tampa Bay is tough at home, the Maple Leafs possess elite offensive talent capable of causing an upset. These generous underdog odds offer value for a team that can explode offensively, even on the road.
